### What is your problem statement?  What will you actually be doing?
Noon is a new online e-commerce website in UAE, KSA and Egypt. Noon in KSA is Suffering from bad reputation due to fact that some sellers inside noon are selling non-original products. Although Noon takes extreme measures when finding such sellers (including banning the seller and re-funding the customer), damage is already done, and the company's credibility is lost. 
Machine learning might help Noon discovering these fraudulent sellers before any incident, and thus, saving their reputation and retaining their customer's trust.

### Who is your audience?  Why will they care?
This project target e-commerce companies in general and Noon in specific. For an e-commerce, reputation and credibility is the most important factor. If people stop trusting an e-commerce website for any reason, that website will most probably go bankrupt. 

### What is your success metric?  How will you know if you are actually solving the problem?
We can measure our success by the number of customer complaints about fraudulent sellers. If it decreases with a certain percentage (the company will decide that percentage) then we can say that we have solved the problem.

### What is your data source?  What format is your data in?  How much cleaning and munging will be required?
The data source is Noon itself. The data is structured data containing the information of the sellers including the banned ones. 

### What are potential challenges or obstacles and how will you mitigate them?

•	For the new sellers it might be more difficult to classify whether the seller is Fraudulent or not. 
It can be solved by analyzing the products that the seller post on the website for the first time or designing another model for analyzing these products.
•	Since the data that Noon have includes people privacy. The way that this data will be shared might impose some challenges.
We will be ready to work with any type of data (e.g. unlabeled data, unknown features).

### Is this a reasonable project given the time constraints that you have?
For fraud detection, the problem is simple classification, which we are very confident dealing with. 
Thus, we believe that such project is very reasonable given the time constrains.
